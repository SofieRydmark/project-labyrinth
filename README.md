# Project Labyrinth

This projects was to build a Labyrinth game that retrieves a list of actions with descriptions from an API, and then present them to the user as interactable items.

## The problem

This week was challenging, to be able to set ut the fetch reqeusts in the Redux reducer the correct way and to be able to show the user the interactive text at the right time. We did mob programming in the beginning to set up the start and then split up in branchens.
